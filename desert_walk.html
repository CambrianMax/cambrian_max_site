			<h3>Desert Walk</h3>


            <p>This is a game I made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/low-effort-jam-6">
                Low Effot Jam 6</a> on itch.io.  I made it over about 4 days in Game Maker Studio 2.  It is pretty simple lol. Here is the link to the its <a href="https://gun-goose.itch.io/desert-walk">
                    itch.io page</a>.</p>

            <p>Note: Sometimes this game doesn't seem to want to start.  Try clicking off the game and then click it again.  Then press space.  That should get it working again. </p>
